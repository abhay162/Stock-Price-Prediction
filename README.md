# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Project Description
This project aims to predict future stock prices using a combination of moving averages and machine learning models such as Linear Regression and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The project leverages historical stock data to train and evaluate models for forecasting stock price trends.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insightful visualizations and trend analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of moving averages and technical indicators.
- **Model Training**: Linear Regression and LSTM models for prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.
- **Visualization**: Graphs comparing actual and predicted stock prices.
